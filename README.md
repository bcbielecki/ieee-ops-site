## Developing Guide

### Requirements

- [Node](#node)
- [Git](#git)
- Text Editor (Recommended: [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
- GitHub Account + Appropriate Repository Permissions

### First-Time Setup

- Install everything needed in the [Installation Instructions](#installation-instructions)
- Make sure you have appropriate permissions
- Clone this repository (Git is required)
- `cd` into the local repository

### Installation Instructions

#### Git

- See this: <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git>

#### Node

- Get the latest LTS Node.js from the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download) for your device (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc).

  - To check if you've successfully installed Node.js, try running `node -v` in your terminal. If a version pops up, you are ready to go.

    - Example:

      ```Powershell
      PS C:\Users\Dylan> node -v
      v16.13.0
      ```

- Double check if `npm` is installed using `npm -v`

  - It should automatically be installed with Node.js

    - Example:

      ```Powershell
      PS C:\Users\Dylan> npm -v
      9.6.0
      ```

#### SASS/SCSS

- Make sure Node.js is installed
- In the local repository, run `npm install` to install Bootstrap and SASS
- To reflect changes in the scss file(s), run `npm run sass` for a one-time compilation, or `npm run sass-watch` for automatic watching of changes

### Running SASS/SCSS

- Run `npm install` in your repository if you haven't already
- Run `npm run sass` for a one-time compilation of scss to css, or `npm run sass-watch` for automatic compilation when the scss files change
  - If you run `npm run sass-watch` and still want to access the command line, create a separate terminal after the command

### Development Process

- (Recommended) Create an issue/pick a specific issue
  - This helps organize the work done on this repository
- Create new branch on GitHub
- Fetch from origin
- Check out branch locally
- Run `npm install` to make sure all the packages are installed
- Develop feature/fix bugs
- Create Pull Request
